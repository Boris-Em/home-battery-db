# Home Battery Database

## Problem

Buying or comparing home battery systems is painful. Specs are scattered across manufacturer PDFs, review sites, and forum posts — with no consistent format. Consumers, installers, and researchers have no single place to filter, compare, and evaluate options side by side.

This site is a structured, up-to-date database of residential home battery systems that makes it easy to find the right battery for any situation.

## Target audience

**Primary: homeowners** researching a home battery purchase. They've typically just gotten a solar quote, experienced a power outage, or been nudged by a subsidy program. They're not technical — they need help translating specs into real-world answers and want to compare options before talking to an installer.

**Secondary: professional installers** who configure and sell systems daily. They already know the specs — they want fast lookup, comparison, and datasheet access to sanity-check a product or find alternatives for a client's budget.

**Markets:** Netherlands · France · United States

Each market has distinct characteristics:

- **Netherlands** — high solar adoption, dense housing, strong grid, net metering phase-out driving battery interest, EUR pricing
- **France** — growing solar market, EDF dominance, different subsidy landscape, EUR pricing
- **United States** — largest market, huge regional variation (California IQ, Texas outages, hurricane belt), USD pricing, installer-driven sales

**Implications for the product:**

- Battery availability varies by market — need per-market availability flags
- Pricing in EUR and USD; subsidies/incentives are out of scope for v1
- Language: English-first for all three markets (v1); localization later
- Content tone: accessible, jargon-light for homeowners; dense and fast for installers
