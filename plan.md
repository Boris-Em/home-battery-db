# Home Battery Database

## Problem

Buying or comparing home battery systems is painful. Specs are scattered across manufacturer PDFs, review sites, and forum posts — with no consistent format. Consumers, installers, and researchers have no single place to filter, compare, and evaluate options side by side.

This site is a structured, up-to-date database of residential home battery systems that makes it easy to find the right battery for any situation.
